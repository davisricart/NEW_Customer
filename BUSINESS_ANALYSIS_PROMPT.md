# Business Analysis Request for Multi-Client Reconciliation SaaS Platform

## Business Context & Background

I've built a **multi-client SaaS platform for automated payment reconciliation** that solves a critical pain point in the beauty/salon industry, specifically for businesses using **DaySmart Salon Software** combined with **third-party fee passing services**.

## The Problem I'm Solving

**Target Market**: Beauty salons, spas, and service businesses using DaySmart Salon Software

**Current Pain Point**: 
- Salon owners use DaySmart for appointment booking and POS transactions
- They also use third-party fee passing software (like CardX, PayJunction, etc.) to pass credit card fees to customers
- **Manual Reconciliation Nightmare**: Owners must manually reconcile data between:
  1. DaySmart transaction reports (shows services, customers, amounts)
  2. Fee passing service reports (shows actual card transactions, fees collected)
- This takes 2-4 hours monthly and is highly error-prone
- Discrepancies in fee collection directly impact profit margins

**Business Impact of Poor Reconciliation**:
- Lost revenue from uncollected fees
- Overpaying credit card processing costs  
- Compliance issues with fee disclosure requirements
- Significant time waste on manual data matching

## My Solution
